# About this repository

This repository is a sample program for GTK that I wrote.

In most cases, it would have ended up as storage waste or something that hadn't been deleted, but I thought that even something like this might be useful to others, so I decided to leave it as Internet waste for now (lol)

It's basically written in Python, and if I have the energy, I've written it in C as well.

You are free to use the code written here, but there is no guarantee that it will work when used. (see UNLICENSE file)

## How to build the C program code
